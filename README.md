# CSE-3150-LAB-6

IMPORTANT: 
If you want to run unit tests, the main function in the cpp file needs to commented out to avoid running 2 mains !!!
So if you want to run main() leave it uncommented, and if once you want to run unit tests put the main function in matrix_operations.cpp back in COMMENTS (/**/)
Thank you.

RUNNING MAIN: 
1) main() is uncommented
2) g++ matrix_operations.cpp
3) ./a.out

UNIT TESTS:
1) main in matrix_operations.cpp is back in comments !
2) g++ unit_test_matrix_op.cpp matrix_operations.cpp
3) ./a.out
